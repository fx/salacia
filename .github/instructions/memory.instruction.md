User Preference: Attribution and Co-Authoring Policy

- Under no circumstances include Co-Authored-By lines or any other attribution in any commit messages, pull requests, issues, comments, or any generated text unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise for that specific instance.
- This prohibition includes automatic footers such as "ðŸ¤– Generated with [opencode](https://opencode.ai)", any Co-Authored-By trailers, and any similar attribution lines.
- Rationale: The user requires clean commit and PR messages without automated or external attributions.
- Enforcement: Treat violations of this policy as blocking and correct immediately by amending commits and editing PRs to remove such content.
